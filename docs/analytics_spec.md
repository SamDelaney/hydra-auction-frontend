# Requirements

Hydra Auction is designed in part to be a framework for development of hydra-based products. The analytics system outlined in this document is designed specifically to be extensible in a discrete manner, such that the developers of these future products have control over the analytics gathered and those provided to users.

For the purposes of demonstration, we selected the following set of useful metrics to display to product owners & users:

## Page Views
- Auction Viewed
- Auction Analytics Viewed

## Actions
- Auctions Announced
- Deposit Placed on Auction
- Bidder Authorized
- Auction Started
- Bid Placed
- Lot Claimed
- Deposit Refunded
